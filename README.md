# Deep Learning-Based Action Recognition for Digital Interventions in Diabetes Management

## Overview
Effective diabetes management requires real-time monitoring, accurate glucose prediction, and actionable feedback to prevent glucose excursions and optimize patient outcomes. Traditional methods often fail to address the complexity and individual variability of glucose dynamics. 

This repository presents a novel deep learning-based framework for action recognition and intervention in diabetes management. The framework integrates advanced predictive modeling with user-centric feedback mechanisms to improve glycemic control and foster patient adherence.

## Key Components
### 1. Adaptive Glucose Monitoring Model (AGM)
- Utilizes a **multi-channel feature encoder** and **temporal prediction module** to accurately forecast blood glucose levels.
- Incorporates a **personalization layer** to adapt to individual variations in glucose dynamics.

### 2. Digital Diabetes Assistant (DDA)
- Provides **real-time risk assessment** for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
- Generates **personalized recommendations** for diet, physical activity, and insulin adjustments.
- Delivers **long-term behavioral insights** to enhance self-management and adherence.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Prediction**: Advanced models for accurate glucose forecasting.
- **Personalized Feedback**: Custom recommendations tailored to individual patients.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous assessment and timely intervention.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Long-term trends and adherence tracking.

## Experimental Results
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework:
- Enhances **glycemic control** by reducing glucose variability.
- Minimizes the risks of **hypoglycemia** and **hyperglycemia**.
- Promotes **sustainable self-management** through actionable insights.
